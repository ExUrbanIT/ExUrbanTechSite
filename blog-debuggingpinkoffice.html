    <p>It’s more than aesthetics — creating a workspace that supports your brain can transform how you show up in tech. 
        Here’s what worked for Judy, and why it might work for you.</p>

      <h2>💡 The Problem Wasn’t the Code — It Was the Chaos</h2>
      <p>Debugging is hard enough on a good day. But if you're neurodivergent — autistic, ADHD, sensory-sensitive, or just deeply
         affected by your environment — it's not just about the code. It's about everything around it. Before I set up my workspace with intention, I found myself:
         Getting overstimulated by overhead lights, Struggling to regulate energy after too many context switches, Feeling boxed in by bland “productivity” spaces
         That’s when I gave myself permission to reimagine what productivity looked like — and surprise: it looked pink.</p>

      <h2>🎨 My Office Is Bright, Cozy, and Loudly Me — and That’s the Point</h2>
      <p>From the bubblegum pink walls to soft ambient lighting and calming textures, every part of my office is on purpose. I’m surrounded by: 
        💖 Warm colors that energize without overwhelming
        ✨ Playful objects that spark joy (yes, even glitter pens)
        🎵 Soundscapes and background loops that help me enter flow
        💡 Task lighting I can control minute by minute
        🧸 A few comfort items that keep me grounded when the code gets gnarly
        When I walk into my space, my brain knows: it's time to create, not survive.</p>

      <h2>🧩 This Is UX for Your Brain</h2>
      <p>If you’ve ever felt like you “should” work in a sterile, minimalist space just because that’s what tech culture shows… throw that out.
        Productivity isn’t beige. Your brain has a user experience. Design around that. If you code better with fairy lights and fuzzy rugs — do it.
        If color helps you think, bring it in. If certain textures, scents, or sounds help you concentrate, make those standard tools — not rewards.
