    <h1>🖥️ Top 5 Tools We Use to Keep Client Sites Running Smooth</h1>
    <p>We’re not just builders — we’re operators. At ExUrban Technologies, we care about what happens after your site goes live.
       Whether you're running a one-page portfolio or a small business storefront, here's how we make sure your site doesn’t just look good… it works reliably 24/7.</p>

      <h2>1. UptimeRobot — Because You Deserve to Know When Your Site Blinks</h2>
      <p>You shouldn't have to find out from a customer that your website is down. We use UptimeRobot to monitor site availability and performance. 
        If anything hiccups — even for a few seconds — we get notified instantly so we can check logs, server response times, and fix it before anyone notices.
        ✅ Bonus: We show our clients how to set this up for free monitoring post-launch.</p>

      <h2>2. Cloudflare — Performance + Protection in One Smart Layer</h2>
      <p>Cloudflare sits in front of your site like a digital bodyguard and turbocharger. It helps pages load faster with caching, protects against basic threats 
        like bots and DDoS, and adds an extra layer of reliability for traffic surges.
        💡 Most of our builds include free-tier Cloudflare DNS & caching — it’s lightweight but powerful.</p>

      <h2>3. Netlify Drop / SiteGround Staging — We Test Everything Before You See It</h2>
      <p>We don’t publish directly to your live site without testing it first. On static builds, we often use Netlify Drop for staging; for WordPress clients,
         we use SiteGround’s staging area. This keeps your public site safe from “Oops, forgot a semi-colon” moments.
        🛠 Staging = safer launches and cleaner code.</p>

      <h2>4. TinyPNG & Squoosh — Optimized Images Without Sacrificing Quality</h2>
      <p>Performance matters — especially for mobile. We optimize all images using TinyPNG or Squoosh to reduce file size without degrading quality. This keeps page
        load times fast, bounce rates low, and SEO happy.
        📸 Before you upload that gorgeous product photo… let’s compress it.</p>
      </section>

      <h2>5. Google PageSpeed Insights — Your Site’s Diagnostic Scanner</h2>
      <p>After launch, we use PageSpeed Insights to audit your site’s load time, accessibility, and best practices. It's not just about the score — it's about what that
         score reveals. We use the report to make post-launch tweaks and offer actionable insights during our optional yearly review.
         📈 If it’s laggy or clunky, we’ll find out why — and fix it.</p>
